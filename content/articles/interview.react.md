## Outside of React, what’s a component as an abstraction?

<br />

## What is component based design?

<br />

## What are the parts that make up a React component?

<br />

## What’s one way data binding?

* One-way data binding will bind the data from the component to the view (DOM) or from view to the component. One-way data binding is unidirectional. You can only bind the data from component to the view or from view to the component.

<br />

## 8. What is state in React?
 
* State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. We should always try to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.

<br />

## 9. What are props in React?

* Props are inputs to components. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation using a naming convention similar to HTML-tag attributes. They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component.

<br />

## 10. What is the difference between state and props?

* Both props and state are plain JavaScript objects. While both of them hold information that influences the output of render, they are different in their functionality with respect to component. Props get passed to the component similar to function parameters whereas state is managed within the component similar to variables declared within a function.

<br />

## 18. What is "key" prop and what is the benefit of using it in arrays of elements?

* A key is a special string attribute you should include when creating arrays of elements. Key prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

## 19.  What is the use of refs?

* The ref is used to return a reference to the element. They should be avoided in most cases, however, they can be useful when you need a direct access to the DOM element or an instance of a component.

<br />

## 21.  What are forward refs?

* Ref forwarding is a feature that lets some components take a ref they receive, and pass it further down to a child.

<br />

## 30. What are uncontrolled components?

* The Uncontrolled Components are the ones that store their own state internally, and you query the DOM using a ref to find its current value when you need it. This is a bit more like traditional HTML.
