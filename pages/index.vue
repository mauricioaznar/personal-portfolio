        <h1 class="my-4">Hello visitor! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
        <p>
          I made this portfolio so you can understand who I am as a professional
          software developer. I want this website to be able to express the work
          and enthusiasm that I feel for programming. Since my beginnings, I
          realized that it is a continuous learning process that never ends so
          having a reference of my work was an obvious choice. This website has
          made developing a much better experience. Now I am able to find small
          pieces of code that have proven to be useful, also by displaying my
          progress to the outside world.
        </p>
        <p>This website is divided in five main sections.</p>
