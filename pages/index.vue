    <h1 class="my-4">Hello visitor! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <p>
      I made this portfolio so you can understand who I am as a professional
      software developer. I want this website to be able to express the work and
      enthusiasm that I feel for programming. Since my beginnings, I realized
      that it is a continuous learning process that never ends so having a
      reference of my work was an obvious choice. This website has made
      developing a much better experience. Now I am able to find small pieces of
      code that have proven to be useful, also by displaying my progress to the
      outside world.
    </p>
    <p>This website is divided in three main sections.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <v-icon>mdi-apps</v-icon><b> App demos: </b>this section is about
        displaying examples that integrate full stack technologies (back-end and
        front-end service).
      </li>
      <li class="mt-3">
        <v-icon>mdi-script-text</v-icon> <b>Articles: </b> this section is about
        guides or opinions about full stack technologies.
      </li>
      <li class="mt-3">
        <v-icon>mdi-code-braces</v-icon><b> Snippets: </b> this section is about
        a reference (mostly for myself) of small pieces of code that I can copy
        paste into new projects.
